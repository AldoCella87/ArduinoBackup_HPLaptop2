// useless machine - a box with a single toggle switch on top with which the user interacts.
// When the switch is turned on by the user the box lid opens and an actuator (perhaps a plastic
// hand or arm from a toy doll) emerges which turns the switch to the off position. The actuator returns to the
// home position and the lid closes.
// See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wWlrBFOdBo for an example.


// Here is the starting point code.  Simply open a fresh Arduino sketch, delete all existing template code and paste this entire file (comments and all) into
// the sketch.  Save it with a unique name such as "MyUseless_V1".  Feel free to save your new versions of this with a different name so you can easily go
// back to a previous version if desired.  Of course, this is just the code to run the motors and read the switch.  You will have to work out the mechanical aspects
// the working of the arm, the placement of the switch, powering the Arduino,etc.  One approach just to get up and running would be to
// simply wire up the motors, switch and LED and test it 'out of the box'.  Each time you turn the switch to the on position the LED should come on and the actuator servo
// should cycle only once.  This would show that the controller and motors are working.  Once you have accomplished this you can build the box.  One
// made of foam core posterboard and duct tape would suffice as a proof of concept. 
// Have fun and Good Luck!
