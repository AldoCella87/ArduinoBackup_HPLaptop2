/* Ping))) Sensor
   This sketch reads a PING))) ultrasonic rangefinder and returns the
   distance to the closest object in range. To do this, it sends a pulse
   to the sensor to initiate a reading, then listens for a pulse
   to return.  The length of the returning pulse is proportional to
   the distance of the object from the sensor.
   The circuit:
  * +V connection of the PING))) attached to +5V
  * GND connection of the PING))) attached to ground
  * SIG connection of the PING))) attached to digital pin 7
